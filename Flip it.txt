I do what I wanna
I stay up like chandelier
Designers on my body know
They watchin' what I wear
My crew so hot, and you are not
I love it when they stare
We pop out lookin' ho-ho-hot
You know (G)I-DLE's here

We don't fly commercial
Only pull up in a jet
Find me in the islands
With these diamonds on my neck
