I do what I wanna
I stay up like chandelier
Designers on my body know
They watchin' what I wear
My crew so hot, and you are not
I love it when they stare
We pop out lookin' ho-ho-hot
You know (G)I-DLE's here


Crazy, sexy, hot
Clique, stop, shake, turn, flip it
Crazy, sexy, hot
Clique, stop, shake, turn, flip it
Crazy, sexy, hot
Crazy, crazy, sexy, hot, flip it
Crazy, sexy, hot
Clique, stop, shake, turn, flip it

Making a mil'
That's a boss girl check
Cutting him off
That's a boss girl flex
