I do what I wanna
I stay up like chandelier
Designers on my body know
They watchin' what I wear
My crew so hot, and you are not
I love it when they stare
We pop out lookin' ho-ho-hot
You know (G)I-DLE's here

Oh, we only take things slow
When we drop it down, drop it down low
Let me know if you ready
In five, four, three, two, one, let's go
