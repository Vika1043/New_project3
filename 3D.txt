So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D (Uh-uh)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti)
I wanna see it
In motion
In 3D

'Cause you know I get hot hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you makin' me crazy
Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it
You give me brand new emotion
You got me drinkin' that potion
